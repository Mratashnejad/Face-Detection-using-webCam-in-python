This project is about detecting faces in images or videos using TensorFlow, which is a popular open-source machine learning framework. It uses a deep learning algorithm to identify and locate faces in a given input. The output is a bounding box around the detected face, which can be used for further processing such as facial recognition, emotion detection, etc. The project uses a pre-trained model from TensorFlow to perform face detection, which can be fine-tuned to achieve better results on specific tasks. Overall, the goal of this project is to build a practical and efficient face detection system using TensorFlow.
